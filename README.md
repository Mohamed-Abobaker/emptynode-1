**Introduction**
This project is a bare bones Node.js web application serving up basic index.html and linked styles.css file. The objective is to:

 - Clone the application to your development PC
 - Commit the basic project to your own github repository
 - Using the IDE of your choice (we use VS Code), make changes to the html/css files in order to create the designed component

**Cloning**
git url:		 https://github.com/cstanleyhns/emptynode.git

**Running**
Before running the application locally, run `npm install` from the terminal to install any dependent packages

**Pointers**
The component is pretty simple. What we would like to see is your approach and clean easy to read coding.

 - Make regular commits along the way to show working 
 - Use the README.md markdown file to document your approach
 - The stylesheet is already added to the project but add your own javascript file to the project 
 - Styling doent have to the same, use your own imagination if you like
 - Think about media queries to create the responsive effect between desktop/mobile
 - Make the button navigate to a different page
