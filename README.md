**Introduction**

This project is a bare bones Node.js web application serving up basic index.html and linked styles.css file. The objective is to:

 - Clone the application to your development PC
 - Commit the basic project to your own github repository
 - Using the IDE of your choice (we use VS Code), make changes to the html/css files in order to create the designed component

**Cloning**

git url:		 https://github.com/cstanleyhns/emptynode.git

**Running**

You may need to install node if you don't have it: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

Before running the application locally, run `npm install` from the terminal to install any dependent packages. To run the application use `node app.js` from the terminal. In your browser, open http://localhost:3000

**Pointers**

The component is pretty simple. What we would like to see is your approach and clean easy to read coding.

 - Make regular commits along the way to show working 
 - Use the README.md markdown file to document your approach
 - The stylesheet is already added to the project but add your own javascript file to the project 
 - Styling doesn't have to be the same, use your own imagination if you like
 - Think about media queries to create the responsive effect between desktop/mobile
 - Make the button navigate to a different page
 - Stick with standard frameworks (i.e. plain javascript and html)
