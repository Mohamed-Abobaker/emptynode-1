**Introduction**

This project is a bare bones Node.js web application serving up basic index.html and linked styles.css file. The objective is to:

 - Clone the application to your development PC
 - Commit the basic project to your own github repository
 - Using the IDE of your choice (we use VS Code), make changes to the html/css files in order to create the designed component

**Cloning**

git url:		 https://github.com/cstanleyhns/emptynode.git

**Running**

You may need to install node if you don't have it: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

Before running the application locally, run `npm install` from the terminal to install any dependent packages. To run the application use `node app.js` from the terminal. In your browser, open http://localhost:3000

**My Approach**

I have approached and completed this task without using any external libraries as requested, and simply worked on it using HTML, CCS and Javascript. By using CSS flex display and the use of media queries I have made it so that the page acts in a responsive manner for desktop / mobile. A h1 tag was used for the title and p tag used for the text below it. The button was created by enveloping a button tag within a hyperlink tag and decorated with CSS, and also made responsive in terms of size.
